      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>After a decade in the Web/Graphic design world, I have developed an instinct for consumer behavior and interactions.  This understanding of consumer behavior comes from my time building websites, logos, packaging, and application interfaces designed for aesthetic and functional use.</p>
      <p>I have combined my experience as a designer/developer, with my degree in economics, into unique UI/UX solutions.</p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
