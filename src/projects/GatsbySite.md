Why did I decided to build my website with Gatsby?

Gatsby can build static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, follow the latest web standards, and optimized. It uses the latest and popular technologies, including ReactJS, Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6+ JavaScript, and CSS.

Static Sites

Unlike the SPAs that make API requests as you run the app, Gatsby does all the data fetching, including data sourcing from local files, during build time. All this data is then used to generate static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. This static rendering is what makes things work faster.

Gatsby in my opinion is by far the fastest way to develop anything from a simple static portfolio site, to a complex static website. The development is really fast and the plugin eco-system is simply amazing.
